1. Iterative method:
* I first ask for the string from the user and store it in a variable, s. 
* I created an empty string to store the reversed version, s2.
* Using for i in range(len(s)-1,-1,-1) 
 i first gets the value of last index in the string
 then we go backwards as the step value is -1
 until we reach the very first character whose index=0 , value just before the stop value -1.
 * s2 += s[i] adds each character in reverse order to s2.
 * Finally, we print the reversed string.

 2. Recursive method:
* Defines a function that reverses a string by calling itself.
* If the string is empty, we return the string itself.
* Recursive case:  The function calls itself with the string minus its first character (string[1:]).
After the smaller string is reversed, it adds the first character (string[0]) to the end of the result.
This process continues until the entire string is reversed.
* Ask the string from the user, call the function.
* Show the final reversed string.
