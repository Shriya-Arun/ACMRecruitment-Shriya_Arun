Problem:
Given an integer array nums, rotate the array to the right by k steps, where k is non-negative.

Solution:
- I ask the user how many elements they want and to enter the elements and then stored them in a list num.  
- I copy the list so I can rotate it without disturbing the original one during the loop.  
- I run a loop k times to rotate the list one step at a time.  
- Inside each loop, I shift every element to the right using newlst[j] = nums[j-1].  
- I updated the original list with the rotated version after each inner loop.
- After the loop is completed, I print the final result.
